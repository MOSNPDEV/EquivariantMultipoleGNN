# Equivariant Graph Neural Network for Atomic Multipoles

## Description
Repository for the Model used in the publication ['Learning Atomic Multipoles: Prediction of the Electrostatic Potential with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05417).
The published model was trained on a subset of a publicly available [Dataset](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/509052) which includes 766110 unique conformations for unique 232230 molecules covering elements {H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl} with up to 20 heavy atoms including potential energies, forces and MBIS multipoles.
